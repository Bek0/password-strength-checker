# Password Security Analyzer

## Description
Password Security Analyzer is a Python tool designed to thoroughly analyze the security strength of passwords. It employs advanced techniques and algorithms to assess various aspects of password security, including complexity, entropy, vulnerabilities, and potential attack vectors.

## Features
### 1. Password Strength Assessment
- Evaluate the strength of passwords based on multiple factors, such as length, character diversity, unpredictability, and resistance to common attack methods.

### 2. Entropy Calculation
- Compute the entropy of passwords using mathematical formulas to measure the randomness and unpredictability of characters, providing a quantitative measure of security.

### 3. Leet Speak Substitution
- Apply Leet Speak substitutions to passwords, simulating common transformation techniques used by attackers to enhance the complexity analysis and identify vulnerabilities.

### 4. Crack Time Estimation
- Estimate the time required to crack passwords using various attack scenarios, including brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, hybrid attacks, and rainbow table attacks, considering factors such as password length, character set, and computational power.

### 5. Common Weakness Identification
- Identify and classify common weaknesses in passwords, including repeated characters, sequential patterns, dictionary words, keyboard patterns, and lack of complexity, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

### 6. Recommendations
- Provide actionable recommendations and best practices for users to improve password security, including guidelines for creating strong and secure passwords, avoiding common pitfalls, and adopting password management solutions.
