    """
    Check if the given password has been exposed in a data breach.
    
    This function hashes the given password using the SHA-1 algorithm and checks
    if the hashed password exists in the Have I Been Pwned database. If found, 
    it returns a warning message along with the count of occurrences, indicating
    that the password has been compromised. If not found, it returns a message 
    indicating that the password has not been exposed.
    
    Parameters:
        password (str): The password to check.
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing a message indicating the status of the password 
            and the count of occurrences if the password has been exposed, otherwise None.
